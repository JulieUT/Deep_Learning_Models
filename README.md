# Deep_Learning_Models
Deep learning models: 
Multiple Perceptron (MLP): estimate total energy consumptionof smart home with weather information.
Autoencoder (with CNN): to remove noise from low resolution photographs (Using CIFAR10 dataset)
Recurrent Neural Network (with LSTM or GRU): to forecast the price of a stock

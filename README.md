# Deep_Learning_Models
Management of Deep Enterprises invited you to participate in their projects preparing solutions for three
 different clients, i.e. a USA energy company, a business involved in photographic restoration and a fund
 management company. As part of the team, you are asked to use your expertise to develop Deep Learning
 solutions in Python. Data for each task will be provided together with a Jupyter Notebook template.
 The company has access to Google Colab (with GPU), which can be employed to speed up the development
 and experimental process of your work.
 
 
Deep Learning Models:
 1. Multiple Perceptron (MLP): estimate total energy consumptionof smart home with weather information.
 2. Autoencoder (with CNN): to remove noise from low resolution photographs (Using CIFAR10 dataset)
 3. Recurrent Neural Network (with LSTM or GRU): to forecast the price of a stock
